  "title": "Hiring PoSciDon Labs to develop PoSciDonDAO's Protocol",
  "body": "PoSciDonDAO needs on-chain governance and I would like to propose to hire PoSciDon Labs to develop a decentralized application with the following features: 1. Create a smart contract to stake SCI tokens and PO tokens. 2. Create a smart contract for governance of DAO operations that executes transactions on-chain once proposals are passed. Each SCI token represents 1 vote unless the proposer chooses to activate quadratic voting. Upon voting on DAO operations proposals, users get the PO token which can be handed in to claim more SCI tokens, access to PO token-gated DAO activities, etc. 3. Create a smart contract for the governance of the funding of personalized medicine research projects. To propose and vote on research funding proposals, you need to be part of the Due Diligence Crew. You can create a DAO operations proposal to become a Due Diligence Crew member. You could for example use your expertise in personalized medicine research and your SCI staking amount to convince community members to become part of the Due Diligence Crew.",
